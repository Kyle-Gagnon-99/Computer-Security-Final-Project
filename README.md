# Computer-Security-Final-Project
This is a website using python's bottle web servlet using HTTP (a possible upgrade to HTTPS) with bottle running on AWS

This is a website created that is made to be a vulnerable and weak website with weak security purposfully implemented into the code. The website will be the target of SQL-Injection attacks and will also be the target of a DoS attack. The website will be running on the python servlet, Bottle (which will be paste which is multi-threaded to make the DoS a bit more challenging to do). Bottle will be running on a remote AWS Ec2 instance. There will be two instances created one for high amount of network traffic and one with low network traffic.
